# The Question
During this activity, you will be given a hypothetical problem to solve and you will create a Python program that will solve this problem for you. You can follow along with the tutorial video posted above this assignment to help you complete it. 

Problem to Solve:

You have just been hired to work for a company called BCC, which is situated in Paramus, New Jersey. When looking at the Annual Profit of the company from the past few years, you've noticed that it is typically 32.5%of the Total Sales made during that same year. This means that if we know the Total sales for the year, we can make an educated guess on how much profit BCC will have. Write a program that asks the user to enter the projected amount of total sales, then display the profit. (Hint: Multiply your total sales by 0.325).

Example of the program:
              Inputs: (what should be appear on the screen for the user to answer)


                         Enter Sales Person Name: (user will enter information and press enter here)


                         Enter Projected Total Sales Amount: (user will enter information and press enter here)

             Output: (What should appear on the screen after answering those questions)         
                         Sales Person Name  : Kevin Cardenas


                         Total sales Amount  : $50,000.00


                         Annual Profits           :  $16,250.00
